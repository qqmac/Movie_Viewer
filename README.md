## Notes

I had spent maybe 3 hours on the required portion of the project. I had tried to implement the search bar but I had no success. I was able to get the movies to filter out with the search, but I was not able to refresh it after the search. My attempt with the the search bar was an extra 3 hours, which is about 6 hours total.
